## Install

```
pip install manifoldco-signature
```

## Usage

`manifoldco_signature` is built to be used with any HTTP handling framework.
As such, you'll need to manually pass in request data in the format the
`Verifier` expects.

In particular, header names must be lowercased and hyphen delimited, and query param names and values must be url-encoded.

If you're using a specific HTTP framework and would like native support for it
included in this library, file an issue and let us know!

```python
import manifoldco_signature as signature


verifier = signature.Verifier()


method = 'PUT'
path = '/v1/resources'
query = {}  # must be url-encoded
headers = {'host': 'yourdomain.com'}
body = 'request body'
valid =  verifier.verify(method, path, query, headers, body)
if not valid:
    # return unauthorized
```
